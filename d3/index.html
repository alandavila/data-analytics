						There is a strong correlation between the percentage of the population in a state that is over 60 years old and has a disability and the percentage of the
						population that has had a stroke.
						<br>
						<br>
						The spread of number of people with a disability over 60 is four times greater than the spread of number of people that has had a stroke. This means that even though
						the correlation among the two variables is strong, the increase in people with disabilities reaching the age of 60 only increases the percentage of people suffering from
						a stroke by a small percent.
						<br>
						<br>
						It is worth noting that while the stoke percent seems to increase at a higher rate after a state's percentage of elder people with disabilities surpasses 35 percent, New
						Mexico does not follow the trend. It would be interesting to investigate if such state has any programs that prevent people from suffering strokes.
